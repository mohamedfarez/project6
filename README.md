Alarm Clock  using Python (GUI)

To develop this python project, 
you need basic knowledge of the Python language and Tkinter library. We are going to need the following libraries:

Tkinter: For the creation of the GUI
Datetime: To get the current date and time from the system
Time: To suspend the execution of the program for some time
Winsound: To play a sound on the computer
All the libraries come pre-installed with Python.
